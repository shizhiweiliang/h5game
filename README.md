# Surprise - A letter from X

## Gameplay Direction:

  There are in all 3 different scenes with each scenes having 3 or less objects to find.Follow the instructions I gave you to find various objects(click to collect)in which clues are hidden. Click it again to reveal the clues.Read the clues and find the next object, until it leads you to the final surprise, a gift from me. 

## Techniques:

  Gift is a HTML5 app developed with integrated workflow, which streamlines the process from design to app stores,with the idea of "write for one, publish for all" in mind, it runs on all major mobile platforms.Also, gift uses a suite of modular libraries and tools, CreateJS, to enable rich interactive content on open web technologies via HTML5. Through the creating process, I used PreloadJS to manage and coordinate the loading of assets, and EaselJS to make working with the HTML5 Canvas element easy.

## Special Thanks to:

Ubio, a famous guitar player whose songs "secret base" is the background music of my game.
